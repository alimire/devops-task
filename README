## Getting Started

### Installation & Running Locally 
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repo

Create a .env file in the project directory to store your environment variable:
 

Install dependencies and initialize:

npm init -y

npm install express-prom-bundle express dotenv


Start the application:

node app.js
The application will start, and you'll be able to access the following endpoints:

GET /login: Always returns a 200 status code.
GET /secret: Returns a JSON object with the "secret" field containing the value from the APP_SECRET environment variable.
GET /metrics: 
Make sure to replace "YourSecretValue" in the .env file with your actual secret.

### Building Docker Image

If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-node-app .
   
## Running with Docker

docker run -p 3000:3000 your-node-app
